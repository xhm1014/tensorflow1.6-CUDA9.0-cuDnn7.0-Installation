# tensorflow1.6-CUDA9.0-cuDnn7.0-Installation

I spend half a day to install tensorflow1.6-cuda9.0-cuDnn7.0 on Win10. Just write it down in case others or myself need it in future.

The following are steps:

1) install Python3.5 for win10
2) install PyCharm Commnunity Edition compliling Python for win10
