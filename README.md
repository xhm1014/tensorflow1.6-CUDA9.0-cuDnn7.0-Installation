# tensorflow1.6-CUDA9.0-cuDnn7.0-Installation

I spend half a day to install tensorflow1.6-cuda9.0-cuDnn7.0 on Win10. Just write it down in case others or myself need it in future.

The following are steps:

1) install Python3.5 for win10
2) install PyCharm Commnunity Edition compliling Python for win10
3) open the PyCharm Settings (see PyCharm Settings.png image), we choose the Python3.5 as the interpreter, by clicking the + button, we install tensorflow1.6.0-gpu and other related packages we need such as pandas, numpy...
